A few characteristics of the task might lead one to think that BERT is not the most appropriate model: syntactic structures matter less for content categories, documents can often be longer than typical BERT input, and documents often have multiple labels. Nevertheless, we show that a straightforward classification model using BERT is able to achieve the state of the art across four popular datasets. To address the computational expense associated with BERT inference, we distill knowledge from BERTlarge to small bidirectional LSTMs, reaching BERTbase parity on multiple datasets using 30{\texttimes} fewer parameters. The primary contribution of our paper is improved baselines that can provide the foundation for future work.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many real-world complex systems including human interactions can be represented by temporal (or evolving) networks, where links activate or deactivate over time. Characterizing temporal networks is crucial to compare different real-world networks and to detect their common patterns or differences. A systematic method that can characterize simultaneously the temporal and topological relations of the time-specific interactions (also called contacts or events) of a temporal network, is still missing. In this article, we propose a method to characterize to what extent contacts that happen close in time occur also close in topology. Specifically, we study the interrelation between temporal and topological properties of the contacts from three perspectives: (1) the correlation (among the elements) of the activity time series which records the total number of contacts in a network that happen at each time step; (2) the interplay between the topological distance and time difference of two arbitrary contacts; (3) the temporal correlation of contacts within the local neighbourhood centred at each link (so-called ego-network) to explore whether such contacts that happen close in topology are also close in time. By applying our method to 13 real-world temporal networks, we found that temporal--topological correlation of contacts is more evident in virtual contact networks than in physical contact networks. This could be due to the lower cost and easier access of online communications than physical interactions, allowing and possibly facilitating social contagion, that is, interactions of one individual may influence the activity of its neighbours. We also identify different patterns between virtual and physical networks and among physical contact networks at, for example, school and workplace, in the formation of correlation in local neighbourhoods. Patterns and differences detected via our method may further inspire the development of more realistic temporal network models, that could reproduce jointly temporal and topological properties of contacts.},

  abstract = {This study assessed user perspectives on library digitization and its impact on research capabilities. A survey design with both quantitative and qualitative approaches was employed. Simple random sampling was used to select respondents whereas purposive sampling was used to select key informants. Data were collected using online questionnaires and interviews. MS Excel was used to analyze quantitative data while qualitative data was analyzed using thematic method. Findings show that the majority of the respondents utilize library resources frequently with statistical analysis (MS\,=\,0.387998, t\,=\,-1.45939, p\,{$<$}\,0.146074) indicating there is no significant difference between education level and the frequency of library resources usage. Also, the majority of respondents have positive perceptions towards the use of library resources with t-statistic (6.599663291, is above 1.649982976 for one-tail and 1.967956506 for two-tail) indicating a significant difference between age and perceptions towards the use of library resources. Moreover, findings show capacity of a single document to be used by many users at once and information to be accessed at a fingerprint are major impacts of library digitization. Furthermore, findings reveal issues related to licensing, subscription costs, and copyright and overwhelming volume of information available as the major challenges user face when utilizing digital library resources. This study marks the pioneering exploration into the impacts of library digitization on research capabilities. The study therefore, recommends a continuous training to students to be able to access and critically evaluate the overwhelming amount of online information. Also, users should be trained on how to navigate copyright issues when accessing digital library resources. Additionally, libraries should consider expanding their collections by incorporating more open access resources. Moreover, parent institutions should make sure that they increase the budget to their digital libraries so that libraries can increase the subscriptions of all useful resources.},

  abstract = {Science, long considered a cornerstone in shaping policy decisions, is increasingly vital in addressing contemporary societal challenges. However, it remains unclear whether science is used differently by policymakers with different partisan commitments. Here we combine large-scale datasets capturing science, policy, and their interactions to systematically examine the partisan differences in the use of science in policy across both the federal government and ideological think tanks in the United States. We find that the use of science in policy documents has featured a steady increase over the last 25 years, highlighting science's growing relevance in policymaking. However, this marked increase masks stark and systematic partisan differences in the amount, content, and character of science used in policy. Democratic-controlled congressional committees and left-leaning think tanks cite substantially more science, and more impactful science, compared to their Republican and right-leaning counterparts. Moreover, the two factions cite substantively different science, with only about 5\% of scientific papers being cited by both parties, underscoring a strikingly low degree of bipartisan engagement with scientific literature. We find that the uncovered large partisan disparities are rather universal across time, scientific fields, policy institutions, and issue areas, and they are not simply driven by differing policy agendas. Probing potential mechanisms, we field an original survey of over 3,000 political elites and policymakers, finding substantial partisan differences in trust in scientists and scientific institutions, which potentially contribute to the observed disparities in science use. Overall, amidst rising political polarization and science's increasingly critical role in informing policy, this paper uncovers systematic partisan disparities in the use and trust of science, which may have wide-ranging implications for science and society at large.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

How does one develop a large number of papers from their first stages to the pages of respected journals? This article discusses the author's system for pipeline management. The system works (1) by separating the difficult exercise of publishing a paper into eight manageable stages; and (2) by organizing a set of papers using these steps according to a practicable timeline.},

The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

In this paper, we present a case study of AI-assisted post-processing; we also show how~AI can help unlock cultural heritage if combined with interactive data visualization. Our case study focuses on the Grand Ducal Archive of the Medici, partially digitized and electronically cataloged by the Medici Archive Project. We used generative AI to post-process the electronic catalog of the Medici's early modern period correspondence, developing a prototype visual finding aid. Throughout the paper, we present the post-processing steps and introduce the visual finding aid.

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {A meta-analysis assessed the behavioral impact of and psychological processes associated with presenting words connected to an action or a goal representation. The average and distribution of 352 effect sizes (analyzed using fixed-effects and random-effects models) was obtained from 133 studies (84 reports) in which word primes were incidentally presented to participants, with a non-opposite control group, prior to measuring a behavioral dependent variable. Findings revealed a small behavioral priming effect (dFE = 0.332, dRE = 0.352), which was robust across methodological procedures and only minimally biased by the publication of positive (vs. negative) results. Theory testing analyses indicated that more valued behavior or goal concepts (e.g., associated with important outcomes or values) were associated with stronger priming effects than were less valued behaviors. Furthermore, there was some evidence of persistence of goal effects over time. These results support the notion that goal activation contributes over and above perception-behavior in explaining priming effects. In sum, theorizing about the role of value and satisfaction in goal activation pointed to stronger effects of a behavior or goal concept on overt action. There was no evidence that expectancy (ease of achieving the goal) moderated priming effects.},

Part I points out a qualitative distinction among physical, biological, and cultural levels, the latter based on man's peculiar ability to symbolize. Part II clarifies the difference between biological and culturological studies of human behavior and argues against subjecting cultural phenomena solely to psychological interpretation. Several essays on the role of the great man in human affairs support the argument. Part III describes the fundamental factor of energy in developing culturological laws, while the final part advances some general comments on "The Science of Culture." 11-page bibliography.

  abstract = {One of the most universal trends in science and technology today is the growth of large teams in all areas, as solitary researchers and small teams diminish in prevalence1--3. Increases in team size have been attributed to the specialization of scientific activities3, improvements in communication technology4,5, or the complexity of modern problems that require interdisciplinary solutions6--8. This shift in team size raises the question of whether and how the character of the science and technology produced by large teams differs from that of small teams. Here we analyse more than 65~million papers, patents and software products that span the period 1954--2014, and demonstrate that across this period smaller teams have tended to disrupt science and technology with new ideas and opportunities, whereas larger teams have tended to develop existing ones. Work from larger teams builds on more-recent and popular developments, and attention to their work comes immediately. By contrast, contributions by smaller teams search more deeply into the past, are viewed as disruptive to science and technology and succeed further into the future---if at all. Observed differences between small and large teams are magnified for higher-impact work, with small teams known for disruptive~work and large teams for developing work. Differences in topic and research design account for a small part of the relationship between team size and disruption; most of the effect occurs at the level of the individual, as people move between smaller and larger teams. These results demonstrate that both small and large teams are essential to a flourishing ecology of science and technology, and suggest that, to achieve this, science policies should aim to support a diversity of team sizes.},

  abstract = {Despite persistent efforts in understanding the creativity of scientists over different career stages, little is known about the underlying dynamics of research topic switching that drives innovation. Here, we analyze the publication records of individual scientists, aiming to quantify their topic switching dynamics and its influence. We find that the co-citing network of papers of a scientist exhibits a clear community structure where each major community represents a research topic. Our analysis suggests that scientists have a narrow distribution of number of topics. However, researchers nowadays switch more frequently between topics than those in the early days. We also find that high switching probability in early career is associated with low overall productivity, yet with high overall productivity in latter career. Interestingly, the average citation per paper, however, is in all career stages negatively correlated with the switching probability. We propose a model that can explain the main observed features.},
