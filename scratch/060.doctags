It appears , at this time 1 that between the high fecal coliform counts which are present almost al1 of the time and the aforementioned percentage of high flows , it would not be safe for recreationists to use the impounded area most of the time</text>
<text><loc_58><loc_107><loc_459><loc_205>Response During the period of October 1965 through September 1976, span of 10 years a daily mean flow of less than 300 cfs occurred on 37 occasions The flow occurred on either Saturday or Sunday on 21 of those As best as can be determined, none of the 37 of Iow flow occurred on Ã  nationa ) holiday . During the period of highest park usage, through September daily mean flows of 300 cfs occurred on 19 On 28 of the 37 the Iow flow period was during the afternoon and evening hours. On three occas the flow persisted during two consecutive days: a Monday and Tuesday; Thursday and Friday; and a Sunday and Monday . These three occurrences were in 1976 In April, 1967 a mean flow of than 300 cfs occurred on four consecutive Friday, Saturday , Sunday and Monday . days days May days days ions 1ow daily 1ow less days:</text>

However , a few studies have made their way into the Titerature One such study indicates the importance of the feca] coliform test. Chapman (1976) reported on an epidemiologic study of hepatitis A in grade schoo] children at Salishon, Washington in 1974 "The outbreak was attributed to contamination by a failing septic tank system to a sma71 stream . The feca] coliform count for the stream was 240/100 The stream was readily accessible to area children and was one of their main play The point here is that the proposed dam would attract many more adults and children to a grossly polluted stream Therefore, the chance of contracting and spreading an enteric disease is greatly increased</text>
