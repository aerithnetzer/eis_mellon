- 1.05 48-inch sluice gates would be incorporated into the weir The gates will be used during 1ow flows of the river The sluice gate on the east end of the weir would be ted between the waterfalls and the east bascule gates \_ The sluice gate on the west end of the weir would be Iocated between the bank and the west bascule gate. This gate would be used to provide adequate water to the existing Public Service Company intake structure Iocated downstream of the weir\_ Gates would be motor operated automatically and would have manua] override capabilities The bottom of the gate open would be located at the bottom of the impoundment just above the of the bedrock. Two Ioca ings top
- 1.06 A water fountain, bank protection, retaining walls and overlook would be constructed on the east bank next to the waterfalls These structures would be constructed in conjunction with proposed park area on the bank. Handrails, stairways and ramps would be constructed in this area for max safety and for the use and convenience of imum

- 1.07 Approximately 11,000 cubic yards of concrete would be required to construct the ogee weir, apron and waterfalls on the east bank The reta on the east bank would require an additiona] 5,500 cubic yards of concrete Approximately 2,000 cubic yards of riprap would be placed on the east bank and 1,600 cubic yards of\_riprap on the west bank downstream of the weir for bank stabilization The riprap would extend 100 feet south of the weir on the east bank and 50 feet south of the weir on the west bank . A total of approximately 225 feet of the bank on the east bank would ining
- stabilization be gabions requiring 600 cubic yards of rock.
- 1.08 Ma intenance dredging of the impoundment would be required approx imately every ten years The material would be removed by a hydraulic dredge and initially contained in a disposal site on the bank \_ No runoff water would be allowed to return to the river The materia} would then be hauled by trucks to a Iand disposal site There are several Tulsa City-County\_Health Department approved mun {cipal and private landfills within the Tulsa area (see Table 1-1) The River Parks Authority would select whichever existing or new site is approved by the Tulsa City-County HeaIth Department and closest, where possible, to the park for disposal as the need arises.
- 1.09 Planned\_Construction: Construction of the weir would be undertaken in four phases during Ã  75-month period To construct the weir, a cofferdam would be required During each construction phase the cofferdam would not exceed 400 feet in length thereby providing approximately 1,000 feet of channe] of construction activities\_ The cofferdams would be approximately 8 feet in height. free
- 1.10 The cofferdans would consist of interlocking sheet pil filled with sand borrowed from the immediate construction site within the river channe} The estimated cubic yardage of sand required for each Iength of cofferdam would be 1,250 cubic yards \_ After completion of each section, the sheet pilings would be removed and the sand smoothed out over tie ing
