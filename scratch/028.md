- 4.26 Figure 4-3 shows that there is à high concentration of feca] coliform in the vicinity of the 2Ist Street Bridge. This is probably due to the inadvertent overflowing of the sanitary sewer lift station Iocated at this point To eliminate this problem, the lift station would be upgraded to handle higher flows
- 4.27 The Iarge storm sewer at the 2Ist Street Bridge is also a source for Iarge contaminated discharges into the proposed impoundment. This selver collects most of the runoff from downtown Tulsa At times of rainfa71 in this area 9 it does carry runoff with a high level of contaminants The operationa] plan of the weir would require emptying the impoundment at times of runotf from this area In weather this storm sewer has discharge of from 3 to 5 cfs\_ Part of this is caused by illega] connections from business and industry in the downtown area These connections are primarily coo] water The applicant would actively encourage the city to provide funding for program to investigate, Iocate and eliminate a71 illega7 connections to the storm sewer The other portion of the storm sewer discharges during weather comes from broken ard leaky sanitary sewer Tines or illega7 sanitary sewer hookups The discharaes fro the IIth Street and Indian Avenue storm sewers also carry large amounts of contaminants To alleviate this problem the weather flows of these storm sewers would be diverted to sanitary sewer Tines to be treated in a sewage treatment plant If the city of Tulsa or the Environmenta] Protection Agency object to this procedure, the weather flows would be chlorinated before being released intc the river dry ing dry dry dry
- 4.28 Water\_Quality Monitoring: Construction of an impoundnent of the Arkansas River produces many unknowns in water quality Although studies are under way to predict water quality in the proposed impoundment, an extens water quality monitoring program will be necessary on a continuing Dasis This program would be a joint effort between the applicant and the Tulsa City-County Hea Ith Department as discussed the letter to the River Parks Authority (Appendix A) It would be funded jointly with the total proposed project. Therefore, tne proposed weir would not be constructed without the water qualitv program being implemented\_ water quality and fish tissue sampling would begin prior to completion of the dam . The toring systemn would become operational at the time the dam is compTeted \_ Potential problems in the impoundment (1) à depletion 0 f dissolved oxygen undesirable anaerobic conditions; (2) immediate problems caused by discharge of high concentration of toxic materials through the storm drain system; (3) contribution of raw sewage chrough bypassing at the sanitary lift stations; (4) dislevels of BOD and feca] coliform during storm water runoff compounds in the sediments and subsequent incorporation into the food chain. A three phase monitoring program is proposed to address these major water quality problem areas ive moni ting
