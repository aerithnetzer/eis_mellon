be answered:

the appllcant Justlfied the 100 year flood flow to 170,000 cfs beceuse of Kaw Lake?

1s afforded now by Keystone and Kav?

What flow w1ll cause floodlng (damage) along thLs reach of the river If the propoged velr Were to be cons cructed?

What range of velocities would be experlenced chrough the gates dur operatlon? ing

What downstrean effects, 1f any , can be expected from che veir regardIng bank erosion?

What 1s meant by the statement in para.
