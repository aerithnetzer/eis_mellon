The advantage of continuous monitoring is the reduction of time for analysis _ To incorporate simplicity into the continuous monitoring program, four parameters have been included These four parameters are: (1) temperature, (2) dissolved oxygen , (3) (4) the capability for specific ion electrode The inclusion of the specific ion would introduce flexibility in the system and a]low for monitoring of any one of many available parameters as deemed necessary by the project. Three sites would be incIuded ir the continuous monitoring program. They are: (1) the proposed weir, (2) Street Bridge, (3) the Street Bridge The monitors would be mounted at midstream and probes be Iocated at the median depth of the norma] operating pool Data from the continous monitors would be telemetered to the operations office of the River Parks Project.

In this program , sequential samp] devices would be located near the mouths of three ma jor storm drains in the River Parks area These drains are the 2Ist Street storm drain, the Indian Avenue storm drain, and the Hth Street storm drain The sequential samplers would be set to collect sample each hour yielding 24 samples per These sainples would be screened for heavy metals, cyanide, and sample for BOD If a specific set of conditions can be identified in association with electroplating waste, it may be possible to develop sampling devices which would collect samples when Ã  particular pollutant exceeds specified levels However, the initial Phases of the sampling program should rely on routine sequential monitoring of the storm drains ing day = grab only</list_item>

Samples would be collected on a weekly basis for determination of nutrient levels On a monthly basis samples would be collected for determination of heavy metals in the   impoundment Those samples collected on quarterly basis would be for chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides poly-chlorinated biphenyls and phenolic compounds The monthly and quarterly samples would be collected at three substations at each of the samp] sites described above Annually , samples of fish tissue and sediments would be collected for the determination of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides poly-chlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals ing ing ing</list_item>
